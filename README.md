This repository serves as a personal collection of my Data Structures (DS) lab tasks, projects, and problem-solving practice. It includes solutions to LeetCode challenges, course assignments, and self-practice exercises. The goal is to document my learning journey, improve problem-solving skills, and build a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures.

Contents include:

📝 Lab Tasks – Implementations and experiments from DS coursework.

💻 Projects – Larger applications and assignments demonstrating applied concepts.

🔑 LeetCode & Competitive Problems – Solutions with explanations where applicable.

🛠 Practice Stuff – Miscellaneous code snippets, explorations, and experiments.

This repo reflects continuous learning and practice — expect updates, improvements, and new problems regularly.
